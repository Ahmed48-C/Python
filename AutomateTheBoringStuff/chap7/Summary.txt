Summary
While a computer can search for text quickly, it must be told precisely what to look for. 
Regular expressions allow you to specify the pattern of characters you are looking for, 
rather than the exact text itself. In fact, some word processing and spreadsheet applications provide find-and-replace features that allow you to search using regular expressions.

The re module that comes with Python lets you compile Regex objects. These objects have several methods: 
    search() to find a single match, findall() to find all matching instances, and sub() to do a find-and-replace substitution of text.

You can find out more in the official Python documentation at https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html.
