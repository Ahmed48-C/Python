# Though dictionaries are not ordered, 
# the fact that you can have arbitrary values for the keys allows you to organize 
# your data in powerful ways. Say you wanted your program to store data about your friendsâ€™ birthdays.
# You can use a dictionary with the names as keys and the birthdays as values. 
# Open a new file editor window and enter the following code. Save it as birthdays.py.
