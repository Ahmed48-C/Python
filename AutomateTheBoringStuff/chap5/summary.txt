Summary

You learned all about dictionaries in this chapter. Lists and dictionaries are values that can contain multiple values, 
including other lists and dictionaries. Dictionaries are useful because you can map one item (the key) to another (the value), 
as opposed to lists, which simply contain a series of values in order. 
Values inside a dictionary are accessed using square brackets just as with lists. Instead of an integer index, 
dictionaries can have keys of a variety of data types: integers, floats, strings, or tuples. 
By organizing a programâ€™s values into data structures, you can create representations of real-world objects. 
You saw an example of this with a tic-tac-toe board.
